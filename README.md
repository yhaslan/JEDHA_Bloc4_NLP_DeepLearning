This repository contains my deep learning project for the validation of Bloc 4 of the RNCP certificate. 
Here is the description of the project:

## Project ðŸš§

One of the main pain point that AT&T users are facing is constant exposure to SPAM messages.

AT&T has been able to manually flag spam messages for a time, but they are looking for an automated way of detecting spams to protect their users.

## Goals ðŸŽ¯

Your goal is to build a spam detector, that can automatically flag spams as they come based solely on the sms' content.

## Deliverable ðŸ“¬

To complete this project, your team should: 

* Write a notebook that runs preprocessing and trains one or more deep learning models in order to predict the spam or ham nature of the sms
* State the achieved performance clearly


## In this project repository you can find:
- _spam.csv_ dataset in the folder _data_
- a _requirements.txt_ file for necessary packages
- *Spam_Detector_Project.ipynb* notebook for the code for text preprocessing, model building and performance evaluation
- *model_performances.png* file that shows the averages and variation in performance of models across 50 samples 
- all trained models with parameters in the folder _models_
